- Create virtual machines with centOS minimal
	- 1x master
	- 1x node
- get root access to master
- yum install epel-release docker ansible git nano -y
- cp /etc/ansible/hosts /etc/ansible/hosts.bak
- use content of included hosts file, adjusted to your needs, for /etc/ansible/hosts
- drop root access and add ssh keys to the user used in hosts-file (ssh-keygen)
- copy ssh-public key to .ssh/authorized_keys on nodes (ssh-copy-id)
- copy ssh-public key to .ssh/authorized_keys on master
- git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible
- ansible-playbook -i /etc/ansible/hosts openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/config.yml --private-key=.ssh/id_rsa -v --ask-sudo-pass
- open openshift dashboard by going to the browser, address of master on port 8443


Troubles with non accesible repo's in build-pod:
adding a proper DNS in /etc/resolv.conf, e.g.:

nameserver 192.168.1.100
nameserver 8.8.8.8

In order to make this change persist when the host reboots or receives a new lease from DHCP, you can create (or append to) the /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file, e.g.:

append domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8;


playbooks/byo/openshift-master/config.yml

In case you have docker images you want to build use this:
oc new-app https://github.com/fkupl/applesandrobots.git --strategy=docker

If, which is the case for quite a few pre-build images, the container needs root privileges, you'd have to change security settings of openshift. For this login to openshift:
oc login https://10.9.4.49:8443 -u system:admin

And then change permissions: 
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default
